I would highly recommend this company as they are all about putting the client first and their goals before presenting ideas. Easy to work with, plus great taste with ability to stay on budget. I had never worked with a designer before and was unsure of what to expect. I also wasn't sure I would get the results I needed since it was only a consultation. We now have a clear picture of how to proceed with our renovation. Thank you, Nitesh! He is professional, attentive and very sweet. He listened to our ideas, concerns and needs and came up with an exceptional plan. After speaking with him and creating the plan for our renovation, the excitement and love for my house returned.I absolutely recommend him to anyone who is planning a renovation. He is easy to work with and my family and I all agree it was the best money we spent.",
